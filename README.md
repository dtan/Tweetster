#Project info for tweetster
This project isn't really meant to do much but read in a twitter feed from a profile.  Yes, it's been done before, but this is more of just an exercise for me to get more familiar with [Node.js][nodejs] and the [Express framework][expressjs].
Express is mainly used for routing, so this might be a little bit overkill for this, but it works on getting current trends from twitter.
